# Docker compose

A little collection of docker compose files used for teaching. My goal is to break them into categories depending on level of difficulty involved in the process. Beginner files will be basic with extra commenting on each line, later levels will have less and only related to relevant changes.

Beginner:
- Nextcloud
- Traefik (v2) - with socket proxy
